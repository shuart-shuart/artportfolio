		<p>
		Shu makes works by reframing and reencountering traces left by others and by time. Her projects often take the form of books, moving images, or other ensembles of printed matter.
		</p></p>
		Her process investigates how knowledge, memory, and creativity emerge, disseminates and is inherited. She is curious about how we learn and create, especially through amateur activities and everyday acts that are unintentionally recorded. This interest stems from her formative years in amateur Chinese orchestras and immersion in internet culture. Recent works draw from informal archives such as handwritten scores and annotations, as well as found online videos and images.
		</p></p>
		Alongside her artistic practice, Shu initiates and produces projects that expand how we encounter art and art books. A long-term project is Part Time Book Club, a collective with Mingli Seet that organises irregular gatherings for sharing and discovering art books.
		</p></p>
